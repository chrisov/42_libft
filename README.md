# libft

This library is a custom implementation of standard C utility functions for string manipulation, memory management,
and character checks. It provides robust, reusable routines for handling common tasks such as converting data types,
managing memory, and processing strings, designed for use in C projects and educational environments. A list with
the included functions follows:

- ft_atoi: Converts a string to an integer.
- ft_bzero: Sets the first n bytes of a memory area to zero.
- ft_calloc: Allocates zero-initialized memory for an array.
- ft_isalnum: Checks if a character is alphanumeric.
- ft_isalpha: Checks if a character is alphabetic.
- ft_isascii: Checks if a character is an ASCII character.
- ft_isdigit: Checks if a character is a digit.
- ft_isprint: Checks if a character is printable.
- ft_itoa: Converts an integer to a string.
- ft_memchr: Scans memory for a specific character.
- ft_memcmp: Compares two memory areas.
- ft_memcpy: Copies bytes from one memory area to another.
- ft_memmove: Copies bytes between memory areas, handling overlap.
- ft_memset: Fills a memory area with a constant byte.
- ft_putchar_fd: Writes a character to a file descriptor.
- ft_putendl_fd: Writes a string followed by a newline to a file descriptor.
- ft_putnbr_fd: Writes an integer to a file descriptor.
- ft_putstr_fd: Writes a string to a file descriptor.
- ft_split: Splits a string into an array of strings using a delimiter.
- ft_strchr: Finds the first occurrence of a character in a string.
- ft_strdup: Duplicates a string.
- ft_striteri: Applies a function to each character of a string, passing its index.
- ft_strjoin: Concatenates two strings into a new string.
- ft_strlcat: Appends one string to another, ensuring no buffer overflow.
- ft_strlcpy: Copies a string to a buffer, ensuring no buffer overflow.
- ft_strlen: Calculates the length of a string.
- ft_strmapi: Creates a new string by applying a function to each character of an input string.
- ft_strncmp: Compares two strings up to n characters.
- ft_strnstr: Finds a substring within a string, searching up to a specified length.
- ft_strrchr: Finds the last occurrence of a character in a string.
- ft_strtrim: Trims specified characters from the beginning and end of a string.
- ft_substr: Extracts a substring from a string.
- ft_tolower: Converts an uppercase letter to lowercase.
- ft_toupper: Converts a lowercase letter to uppercase.
